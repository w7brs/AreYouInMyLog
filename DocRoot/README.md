# Where to place the files


This directory represents your document root.

Place the `lookup` folder into the root of your DocumentRoot
(or otherwise configure the CGI `ayiml.cgi`)

Place the CGI script into wherever your Server is configured for
holding CGI scripts.


## Setting up CGI

Not in scope of this project -- plenty of information sites out there
to configure your system to enable CGI.

Or, roll up sleeves and rewrite the CGI as a PHP and enable that..

I may get to it one of these days...

# Things to do...

1. Update instructions to make it dirt simple.
2. Simplify the perl code.  It's a bit redundant.  It grew organically as my needs saw fit.  I didn't intend to share it when I wrote it, but now that it is shared -- I should optimize and refactor the code just a bit.. 
3. Explain the gory details of the Log4M database schema.  It's their schema so the details are in their documentation.  But I should explain it anyway.
4. Make it a touch easier to customize.  Less in-code editing.
